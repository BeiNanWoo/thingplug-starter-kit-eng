\[Figure 1\] Purpose of ThingPlug Starter Kit

### Main Features and Functions of ThingPlug Starter Kit for LoRa

-   It is a module that enables service testing even though there is no actual device used.

-   It provides REST API of oneM2M, a global standards initiative for M2M communications and IoT.

-   It consists of node.js and express web application framework, thus enables easy development and modification.

-   It provides sample interface between data and service through various built-in components such as IFTTT, map, graph, etc.

-   Samples are uploaded in the Github. It is possible to download directly from the Github.

    1.  ### Major Components of ThingPlug API

Starter Kit consists of the following four components depending on their roles.

<img src="./media/image5.png" width="723" height="400" />

\[Figure 2\] ThingPlug Starter Kit Composition

-   Application client (Application)

-   Device client (Device)

-   ThingPlug server that provides oneM2M API (ThingPlug)

-   LoRa network server

Application and device do not communicate with each other directly. All components in the Starter Kit communicate with oneM2M server using REST API, which is provided from the ThingPlug. Common IoT functions (e.g. saving data, managing devices, registering devices, etc.) provided through the relevant API will present the device and application developers the environment where it is easier to develop LoRa services.

> <img src="./media/image7.png" width="690" height="451" />
>
> \[Figure 4\] Download Starter Kit from github

-   `config_x.js`: It contains necessary environment setting values such as developer key, device ID, etc. Developer should modify the values according to his/her condition.

-   `device_mqtt_x.js`: It is a code, made by Node.js, that can run in the actual IoT device. It can run on any computer or IoT device (e.g. [BeegleBone Black](http://beagleboard.org/black)), where Node.js can be executed. This js file uses mqtt protocol.

-   `device_http_x.js`: It is an http version of the device.js.

-   `application_web.js`: It is a web API server that uses Express.js. It plays the role of backend server that responds to the call of sample web application. It shows users the data sent from `device.js` to ThingPlug or receives command from web page and actually controls device through the ThingPlug server.

-   `public/`: It is a static file list (html, css, javascript, etc.) of sample web application.

-   `notification/`: There is a file related to email that is used to notify problem when a trigger occurs. Currently, email is sent using nodemailerapi. Enter the GMAIL account into mail.js. Developer can use various other methods besides this using the library of node.js.

> Currently, the sample is mapped in ***{js filename***`_number}` format to support the multi device.

There are several modifications required to change the number of the device.

1.  Add or delete the `config_x.js` and `device_x.js` files (number should start with 1 consecutively)

2.  Modify the node ID of `config_x.j`s

3.  Modify the`numOfDevice` of `application_web.js`

4.  Modify the `numOfDevice` of `/public/js/app.js`

### <span id="프로젝트-dependency-설치" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc462242525" class="anchor"></span></span>Install Project Dependency

Device and application executed by Starter Kit are within the Node.js and relevant dependency information is entered in the package.json. Go to the starter kit folder (where package.json exists) copied in the former process and install the dependency using `npm install`` command.`

<span id="config.js-수정" class="anchor"></span>

### Modify config.js

To run the Starter Kit normally, it is necessary to modify the information of developer account and device according to the developer’s condition. Copy `config.js_sample` file to `config.js` file and then open `config.js` from the editor. Refer to the comments and descriptions below when modifying the file.

| 3. Create Container        | Create container for saving data. It is similar to folder in file system.                                                      | POST                       |
| 4. Create mgmtCmd          | Create resources including control command that can be accepted by the device. In case of LoRa, there are predefined commands. | POST                       |
| 5. Create Content Instance | Record the sensor data into specified container.                                                                               | POST                       |
| 6. Update exec Instance    | Update the result of exec Instance sent from the ThingPlug.                                                                    | PUT                        |

-   In case of MQTT version, device actions are divided based on the `isRunning` status. Receive response from the ThingPlug through `Subscribe` and request for HTTP to ThingPlug through `Publish`.

<img src="./media/image8.png" width="571" height="386" />

`
`

-   `To send the actual sensor data to ThingPlug and receive relevant response from the application, ``modify the CON value, which is a parameter of ``contentInstance`` in ``device.js`` files.`

<img src="./media/image9.png" width="714" />

`In the sample above, modify the ``value_Temp``.`

### <span id="device가-하는-일" class="anchor"><span id="thingplug에-내-계정에-device를-등록" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc462242528" class="anchor"></span></span></span>Register Device into Your ThingPlug Account

#### Sign Up

When two devices (B and C in the figure below) are registered under the user A, user D should not be able to access the two devices. uKey is used to handle this kind of cases and user can get it by signing up.

-   **uKey **

    -   Access token key that judges whether an access from an external system to the ThingPlug Rest API is normal or not.

(Use uKey as a user credential of Mqtt client)

<img src="./media/image11.png" width="670" height="375" />

\[Figure 6\] Necessity of uKey

1.  **Sign up: [https://thingplugdev.sktiot.com](https://thingplug.sktiot.com/)**

<img src="./media/image12.png" width="624" height="374" />

<img src="./media/image13.png" width="624" height="443" />

1.  **User authentication key: uKey (created by the system)**<img src="./media/image14.png" width="599" height="265" />

#### Register Device

Register the device (created remoteCSE) into the ThingPlug portal so that application can send necessary control commands using the ThingPlug oneM2M REST API.

-   Before registering the device, node and remoteCSE resources should be registered successfully into the ThingPlug portal.

-   Device is identified by device ID (nodeID) and passCode

    -   **passCode**

        -   It is a user-defined password that will be used to identify device in the portal (4 – 16 characters or numbers).

        -   It will be used when registering device.

        1.  Log in to \[ThingPlug\] &gt; My Page &gt; My Device &gt; Add Device.

            <img src="./media/image15.png" width="624" height="300" />

        2.  Enter the device ID (LTID) and passCode of Config.js into the Single Upload section and then click Verify Device Info button.

            <img src="./media/image16.png" width="624" height="364" />

        3.  Enter the following information into the Required Information section and then click Save button.

        4.  Device is registered successfully into the ThingPlug.

            <img src="./media/image17.png" width="624" height="413" />

1.  Check the registered device from My Page &gt; My Device.

    <img src="./media/image18.png" width="624" height="275" />

### <span id="application-실행" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc462242529" class="anchor"></span></span>Execute Application

`Execute the application using ``node application_web.js` command. (Before executing the application, d`evice.js` should operate normally.) So, do not terminate the execution of `device.js`, but just open a new terminal (command window). ``

Go to [http://\[SERVER\_IP\]:3000/dashboard](http://[SERVER_IP]:3000/dashboard) to check the web page.

In the above web page, it is possible to view the location of device and values of 3 virtual sensors, execute mgmtCmd that is predefined in the device, and send email notification by setting trigger when event occurs.

FAQ
---

#### Welcome. Now you are a ThingPlug LoRa IoT user.

You are finished with preparing all the required settings for the SKT ThingPlug LoRa using this Starter Kit. Now make the service you want using the application and device codes. Contact [ThingPlug Developer Community](https://sandbox.sktiot.com/IoTPortal/cmmnty/cmmntyList) when you have any question while developing service.

#### For more information of the Starter Kit, refer to the ThingPlug Guidebook.

Refer to the [IoT Service Development with ThingPlug](http://book.naver.com/bookdb/book_detail.nhn?bid=9766474).

#### Do I need to register resources every time I execute the device?

No. You need to register the resources of each device only once at the very first time. In this Starter Kit, resources are registered every time you execute the device. Still, there is no problem with this process. However, when you try to use the same ID, conflict (HTTP : 409, MQTT : 4015) message will occur.

#### I can’t find user authentication key in My Page.

You must select HTTP for the device interface protocol when you sign up the ThingPlug portal. If not, you won’t be able to use oneM2M API. You can select this option only when you sign up the portal. Therefore, create a new account using a new ID and make sure to select HTTP option.

#### I cannot connect to MQTT.

Check if your ThingPlug ID and uKey are entered normally in the config file. When clientId is overlapped with someone else’s, it may cause problem.

#### I cannot see the sensor data.

Check if you registered device into the ThingPlug portal also. If device is not registered in the portal, uKey is not properly mapped and application cannot access the device.

#### It says that config.js does not exist.

Check if you modified the sample codes or deleted sample from the file name.
